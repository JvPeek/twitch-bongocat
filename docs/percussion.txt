I updated the Percussion here because i think its a good way to match some kind of standard. 

I choose the standard on Midi Channel 10 for Drum kits, instruments are in a fixed order.

example for the first 12 notes on midi channel 10:

35 Bass Drum 2
36 Bass Drum 1
37 Side Stick
38 Snare Drum 1
39 Hand Clap
40 Snare Drum 2
41 Low Tom 2
42 Closed Hi-hat
43 Low Tom 1
44 Pedal Hi-hat
45 Mid Tom 2
46 Open Hi-hat
47 Mid Tom 1
48 High Tom 2

The keys "A" to "L" are used for the drums now, so 9 keys in total. So just "Bass Drum" to "Low Tom" from the Midi arrangement are in use. 
this is not the best choice but useful enough and make it easy in case you will play midi files at some point. Also this list can be expanded according to the Midi standard. 

Sound now are samples of an 1980's analog Drum synthesizer called TR808 by Roland, should be well known and had an iconic cheesy 80th sound! so this is proof enough to use it!

the Drum samples names are like the Midi name but without whites-space:

BassDrum2
BassDrum1
SideStick
SnareDrum1
HandClap
SnareDrum2
LowTom2
ClosedHiHat
LowTom1
